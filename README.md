Gamified Investing Platform

We have been building a token [LMS] and a staking platform. The tokenomics and the ideas used in this platform can create an infinite buy pressure on the token. 

Users incur a 2% fees when they buy the token which goes directly to the developers as revenue for reinvestment in the protocol and a 5% fees when they stake the token on the staking platform which goes into a jackpot pool. Now here is where the greed/degen factor comes into play, the jackpot pool is given to the last staker if there has not been a staking event on the platform by anyone in the last 24hrs. A unique wallet is only allowed to stake and unstake on the platform once every 24hrs. There is a minimum staking amount that will be set and any investment below that amount will not be allowed. We have more incentives to keep the tokens staked on the platform, there is a staking apr that users can benefit from and can choose to withdraw or compound into their main balance.

Make sure you are on Mumbai testnet.
