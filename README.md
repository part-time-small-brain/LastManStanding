Gamified Investing Platform

The basic idea behind LastManStanding is to create an infinite buy pressure on the token LMS by using human greed and some psychological tricks. LastManStanding comprises of a token and a staking platform.  

Users incur a 2% fee when they buy the token which goes directly to the developers as revenue for reinvestment in the protocol and a 5% fee when they stake the token on the staking platform which goes into a jackpot pool. Now here is where the greed/degen factor comes into play, the jackpot pool is given to the last staker if there has not been a staking event on the platform by anyone in the last 24hrs. A unique wallet is only allowed to stake and unstake on the platform once every 24hrs. There is a minimum staking amount that will be set and any investment below that amount will not be allowed. We have more incentives to keep the tokens staked on the platform, there is a staking APR that users can benefit from and can choose to withdraw or compound into their main balance.

**Let's take an example** 

Let's say the jackpot pool has been funded with 100,000 LMS. Alice has 1000 LMS tokens and stakes it on the platform, 50 LMS will be transferred to the jackpot pool and Alice will be left with 950 LMS locked on the platform for 24hrs earning staking APR during that time period. After 23 hrs, other people will notice that only 1 hr is left and Alice will win the 100,050 LMS as a jackpot amount + 950 LMS that will be unlocked. Bob comes into play and stakes 1000 LMS tokens at the last moment, now he becomes the previous staker of the protocol, and the 24hr timer resets. The jackpot pool has been increased by another 50 LMS, which will attract more players and the cycle will continue until someone wins the jackpot pool. The game will automatically restart after it.
